## What is this?

Do you like iOS but without the iPhone? Well, you can use an app called Nova Launcher to make your Android look like an iPhone. That way, you can enjoy the perks of Android, while having a better look. 

## Instructions

Thankfully, it is a simple process to make your phone look like an iPhone as long as you can download the app, download the Nova file, and have a desire to customize. 

1) First you will want to download the Nova Launcher app which can be found [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher)
2) Download the Nova file by clicking on the *Android-to-iPhone.novabackup* in GitHub (also found [here](https://github.com/grpchatdstryr/Nova-Launcher/blob/main/Android-to-iPhone.novabackup))
3) Open Nova Launcher, go through the basic set up process
4) In Nova Settings, click *Backup & restore*, and click *Restore backup*
5) Find the Nova file you downloaded from GitHub and choose that as a backup
6) It will ask you to confirm that your current Nova Setup will change, that is fine
7) Congrats! You now have an *iPhone*!

Since I most likely am using different apps than you, you will have to set up icons manually. It may be greyed out, which means you don't have the app. If you want to fix the app, select the app you use instead from your app drawer and drag it to the icon. You can remove the greyed icon. However, if you want to add a custom icon, it's an easy process. To do so, follow the steps below. 

1) Find the app you want to change the icon for
2) Long press it, and click the pencil icon
3) You can change the name and picture
4) If you have Nova Prime, you can customize gestures and Notification badges which add extra functionality
5) Tap the icon and select *Gallery apps*
6) Find where the picture is stored, and select it
7) Click *DONE*

There you go! That is the basics of Nova Launcher and the iPhone Theme. If you don't like parts of the theme, you can customize it to your desire through the Nova Settings app. That is the beauty of Nova Launcher!

If you want even more functionality, you can get Nova Prime, which in my opinion is worth it. It allows you to set custom screen gestures and even app specific gestures. For example, I added double tap to turn off the screen. So instead of picking up my phone to turn it off, I can just double tap anywhere on the home screen to turn it off. With the app specific gestures, I have Google Maps to open if I tap it. However, if I swipe *down* on the icon, it will open Google Earth. That way my home screen stays clean and only have 1 icon instead of 2. Some may say that is pointless or just extra, however I like it that way and Nova Launcher allows me to do it. The point is that you can customize your home screen the way *you* like it. I hope you can enjoy your new iPhone layout and make fun of your Apple friends! Happy customizing!
